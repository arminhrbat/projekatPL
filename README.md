My task was to create a "4 in a row" game using one of the following programming languages: Rust, Go, Ruby, or Scala. I chose Ruby for my project. Ruby is a programming language known for its easy-to-understand syntax, which has some similarities to Python. Given my prior knowledge of Python, I opted for Ruby.

The game is designed for two players to compete against each other, not against the computer. Players take turns moving. Before the game starts, the user is asked if they want to start a new game or load an existing one. After choosing to start a new game, they enter the size of the game board, with a minimum size of 6x7. The game then begins.

The winner is the player who forms a row of 4 pieces vertically, horizontally, or diagonally. Additionally, at any time during the game, the user can save their progress in a file called "saved_game.txt" by typing "save" when making a move. After that, the game is saved and stopped.
